h1. Avalanche

p. On this project our major goal is to make an engine that makes easier for game making, without reducing performance or limiting like other tools. We also want it to be Free and Open Source. And that's why we chose it to be done using Vala.

p. Please note that being Free and Open Source does not excludes the possibility of writing proprietary profitable games, so we also make it easy to create such projects.

p. On our examples we also use SDL2 and Chipmunk, which are completely optional.

* Support for android is on the way: We're already able to compile ours examples to an android compatible library and run it, but it seems like SDL is not responding normally.

* Editor development is suspended for undefined time.

h1. Building

h2. General Requirements

p. Our engine uses Vala, so you're gonna need at least this tools:

* "GCC":http://gcc.gnu.org/ (Linux) or "MinGW-w64":http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/ (Windows)
* "GLib":https://developer.gnome.org/glib/
* "Vala":https://live.gnome.org/Vala/

p. To build any of our examples, also install:

* "SDL 2":http://www.libsdl.org/hg.php
* "SDL2_Image":http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* "SDL2_TTF":http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
* "SDL2_Mixer":http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
* "SDL2-GFX":http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/software-mainmenu-14/4-ferzkopps-linux-software/19-sdlgfx
* "Chipmunk Physics":http://chipmunk-physics.net/

p. To build to android, you can:

* Download one of ours pre-built toolchains (which includes every necessary library) on page "Useful files":https://github.com/avalanche-games/avalanche/wiki/Useful-files in our wiki.
* Or, if you prefer to, build from Android NDK a standalone toolchain and then compile every needed library,

h3. Deploy on Linux

p. Linux developers, can use package managers, to install programs and it dependencies, so they don't have reasons to build anything statically, just make a package to your targeted distribution and let the package manager do it is work.

h3. Deploy on Windows

p. On Windows you'll find a pre-built package for adding all requirements to MinGW-w64 on page "Useful files":https://github.com/avalanche-games/avalanche/wiki/Useful-files in our wiki.

h3. Deploy on Mac

p. * TODO *

h2. Play a Game

h3. On Windows

p. You might include needed DLLs, but do not forget their licenses when needed.

h3. On Linux

p. Add Glib and SDL2 to the package dependency list.

h3. On Mac

p. * TODO *

h2. Hacking

p. If you want to contribute to the project, first, note that everything you pull to this project is copyrighted to the contributors (which will include you). If you do not want to be an official contributor, just fork the project and pull your commits to the main repository, you should also keep our coding style:

<pre>
// Root namespace on a fake '-1' indentations level
namespace A {
// do not write 'using'

// Type is camel case, do not refer to glib directly, but always refer to others
public class SyntaxSample : Object {
    // Tabs instead of spaces
    public void x_e(int y, float x) {
		/* Comments on separated lines
		 * Any multi-lined comment over ** and any single over //
		 * Between 80 to 120 characters per line (even code)
		 * Indentation: 1 Tab
		 */
		int z_a;
		// Space before every comment
		if(y > x) {
			// Explicit namespaces, no "using" statements 
			z_a = A.B.do_sth(x, y, z, a, b, c, d, e, f , g,
			h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o , p);
		// Space before every opening bracket
		}else {
			A.B.do_otherth(y);
		}
		// If needed remember to do the correct usage of &\&&
	}
}// SyntaxSample << This kind of comment is for remembering what is being closed


public enum  SomeEnum {
	ALL_UPPER_CASE, WITH_UNDERSCORE
}// SomeEnum


}// A
</pre>

p. If you follow those styles guidelines your commit might be accepted.

h2. Problems

p. If something is bothering you, you should really create an issue on our GitHub, we have no restriction about the
issues that you should create, but we ask you to:

p. Give information about your Operational System, GCC version, Vala version, and everything you tried to do to fix
the problem, if some commit were added, sending it might help solving the problem.

h3. About Build Issues

p. You should avoid to create issues to unsupported ways of building the editor.

For build issues use a name like `Build Error on Operational System - Details`, where "Operational System" is
your "Windows / Mac / Linux Distro" version, "Details" might be what you think that is causing the problem.
