Garnet Framework:
 -> The framework behind the game.

Garnet Gemstones[1]
 -> Game addons, usually vala scripts.

Garnet Engine:
 -> The editor.

Garnet Veins:[1]
 -> Mini Ruby/Lua scripts that add functions to Garnet.

* NOTES:
	[1] Only on a Late version

		Garnet Engine needs some things (importance order):
			Resource Store
			====================
			Yes, we will have a store[1] :D (with gtk interface, nothing about webkit).

			Graphics:
			 -> Project's Charsets (npcs, chests etc).
			 -> Project's Tilesets (the `map`).
			 -> Project's Backgrounds (backgrounds).
			 -> Project's Artworks (artworks).
			 -> Project's Sprites (everything else).

			Musics:
			 -> Project's BGM (background musics).
			 -> Project's BGS (background sounds).
			 -> Project's MEX (music efects).
			 -> Project's SFX (sound effects).

			Extensions Gemstones:[2]
			 -> Project's Gemstones (game extensions).
			 -> Project's Veins (editor extensions).

			The project must be portable! (run on any Garnet platform) So every extension is
			distributed with source, and are recompiled on another platforms. (we list
			dependencies too, and there's also autoupdate)

			* NOTES:
				[1] Only in some years(or less)...
				[2] We also do not dream about distributing that things now...

			Content Editor
			====================
			-> Level Editor.
				Holds events and objects (instanteated from a object model 
				from object collection).

				-> Environment Editor (what it means).

			Database Editor
			====================
			Actually a REAL database.
			I will find a way to make this thingy as interactive as json.

			Scripting
			====================
			-> Events Editor.
				Creates Events Collections and edit events.

				Events can be game objects (that can be instantiated and etc),
				os just do things statically.
				Events may be used outside of a map (commom event) without need of a object.

				$ Occurence Condition => Behavior

				-> Behavior.
					Is just a list of things to do, will likely be json OR binary (or both, 
					json only on debug).

			NPC's, Chests and Interactive Stuff
			====================
			-> Object Editor.
				Creates Objects Collections and edit objects.
